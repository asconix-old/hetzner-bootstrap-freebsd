# hetzner-bootstrap-coreos

This gem allows to bootstrap FreeBSD on a Hetzner root server.

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/hetzner-bootstrap-coreos.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/hetzner-bootstrap-coreos)

## What it does:

We have a considerable number of [FreeBSD](http://www.freebsd.org) servers in production and usually run FreeBSD on bare metal servers hosted at Hetzner. To get the maximum separation of services and a very high security level we usually run all services in FreeBSD jails. To get a repeatable setup it's very important to have a way to automate the provisioning of the hardware. This is where this Ruby gem comes into play. It automates the entire provisioning process especially for the Hetzner root servers.

Warning: All existing data on the system will be lost!

## Requirements:

First of all retrieve your API login credentials from the Hetzner admin interface at [https://robot.your-server.de](https://robot.your-server.de). Additionally you need the IP address of the system that you want to provision.

## Implemented steps:

1. Enable Rescue Mode (using Hetzner's webservice)
2. Resetting the System to boot into rescue mode (using Hetzner's webservice)
3. Log into the rescue system and launch the installation
4. Reboot
5. Verify installation (very basic check but can be overwritten)
6. Copy your local SSH public-key into root's `.authorized_keys`
7. Adds the generated server key into your `$HOME/.ssh/known_hosts` file
8. Execute `post_install` hooks (optional)

## Example:

See `example.rb` file for usage.

Warning: All existing data on the target system will be lost!

```ruby

#!/usr/bin/env ruby
require "rubygems"
require "hetzner-bootstrap-freebsd"

# Retrieve your API login credentials from the Hetzner admin interface
# at https://robot.your-server.de and assign the appropriate environment
# variables ENV['ROBOT_USER'] and ENV['ROBOT_PASSWORD']

bs = Hetzner::Bootstrap::FreeBSD.new(:api => Hetzner::API.new(ENV['ROBOT_USER'], ENV['ROBOT_PASSWORD']))

# The post_install hook is the right place to launch further tasks (e.g.
# software installation, system provisioning etc.)
post_install = <<EOT
  # TODO
EOT

bs << {:ip => "1.2.3.4",
  :hostname => 'artemis.asconix.com',
  :public_keys => "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub",
  :post_install => post_install
}

bs.bootstrap!

```

## Thank you greeting

This Ruby gem is inspired by the [hetzner-bootstrap](https://github.com/rmoriz/hetzner-bootstrap) gem and requires the underlying wrapper for the Hetzner server management API [hetzner-api](https://github.com/rmoriz/hetzner-api). Thus I want to thank [Roland Moriz](https://roland.io/developer) a lot for his great work!
